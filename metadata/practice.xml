               You wake up alone in the Library.
               It's dark.
               Moonlight creeps in through the old gaping double
               windows across the narrow hallway. 
               You must have over slept; hidden from vision
               in the corner of one of the vast hallways the
               CCSF staff must have assumed everyone cleared out.

               The lights outside the parking lot are flickering erratically.
               The fog makes it difficult to make out objects in the distance,
               though you swear you can see someone next to the parking meter
               rocking casually back-and-forth...
